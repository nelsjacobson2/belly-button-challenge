## Introduction

This project aims to provide an interactive and informative dashboard for exploring the belly button biodiversity dataset. The dataset contains information about various microbial species found in the belly buttons of individuals. The dashboard visualizes this data using bar charts, bubble charts, and a gauge chart to provide insights into the microbial diversity and washing frequency of each sample.

## Technologies

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- HTML: Markup language for creating the web page structure.
- CSS: Stylesheet language for defining the visual appearance of the web page.
- JavaScript: Programming language for implementing interactive functionality and data manipulation.
- D3.js: JavaScript library for data visualization.
- Plotly.js: JavaScript library for creating interactive charts.

## Setup

To set up the Bellybutton Biodiversity Dashboard locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

Upon opening the web page, you will see the Bellybutton Biodiversity Dashboard. It consists of the following components:

- Test Subject ID No.: A dropdown menu to select different sample IDs.
- Demographic Info: Displays metadata information for the selected sample.
- Top 10 OTUs Bar Chart: Shows the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) in the selected sample.
- Bacterial Cultures Bubble Chart: Visualizes the abundance of different bacterial cultures in the selected sample.
- Belly Button Washing Frequency Gauge Chart: Displays the washing frequency of the selected sample.

To explore the data:

1. Open the web page.
2. Select a sample ID from the dropdown menu.
3. The bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge chart will update to show data specific to the selected sample.
4. The demographic information will also update to display the metadata for the selected sample.
